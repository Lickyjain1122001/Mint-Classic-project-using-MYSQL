# Mint-Classic-project-using-MYSQL
In this project be solve the problem of warehouses of the company called Mint Classic a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles

#Understanding the Dataset
In this Dataset we have all the data of company Mint classis data like its customer's data, their product details, their warehouses 
their employee's, there stocks, their orders details and more but be have to focus on the problem the want us to solve and select the data according to that.

# Database used
* MYSQL 
* I have found some important and useful insight from Mint Classic datasete by writing the optimized SQL quries in MYSQL RDBMS.
I wrote 12 SQL quries using this dataset. for each of the quries you would find the problem statment in the question pdf file

# Reccomendation:
1. Mint classic company should shift some stocks of product from less demand area to more demand area.
Like for Classis Cars Sweden has more demand in 2003 and in 2004 Belgium has more demand and in 2005 Canada and Canada is the top consumer of Trucks and buses and vintage cars also so it can shift some  stocks from the places where the demand is not that much to Canada
2. USA has the greatest number of customers  or client of the company so we can focus on the Warehouse s of USA  and keep more stocks of products there
3. Since USA  has the greatest number of customers  but the number of employees is less Mint classic can hire more employee to maintain the warehouse
4. The company should focus more in the months like August, September, October, November, December these are the month where we get a greater number of orders
